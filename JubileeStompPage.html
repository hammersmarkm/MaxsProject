        <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9_TMwLimw&si=q1MerHL02wIfq9F5">Jubilee Stomp</a> is a song by famous jazz composer and pianist Duke Ellington. This big band piece was first performed and recorded in 1928 and is an example of a song in a period where jazz was gaining immense prominence. The time when this song was released (1920s-30s) was called the “Jazz Age”, this time was when jazz quickly gained worldwide popularity. This sudden thrust into the mainstream was hugely felt in the United States, the birthplace of jazz, where radio had just become popular (<a href="https://wjccschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/05/The-Jazz-Age.pdf">Source</a>). Radio becoming popular gave jazz the last boost it needed to cement itself as a key part of American culture. Jazz becoming popular also allowed African-Americans to use jazz (an African-American creation) to become well known musicians, which was very rare for that community of people before jazz.
