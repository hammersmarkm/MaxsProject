        <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jqFIwbV_pSw&si=H-O7fOsztLJ6TdnW">Sing, Sing, Sing</a> is a jazz standard often associated with the Benny Goodman big band (they would close their shows with it). This song was written by Louis Prima. This piece is a prime example of “swing” style jazz, which is dance music. This style of music was broadcasted across America nightly for many years (<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/benny-goodman-about-benny-goodman/615/">PBS</a>).
